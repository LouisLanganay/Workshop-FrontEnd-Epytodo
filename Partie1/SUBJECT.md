# Creating a new React project with TypeScript

In this section, we will create a new React project with TypeScript using the `create-react-app` tool. This tool allows us to quickly set up a new React project with all the necessary configurations and dependencies.

:arrow_right: Follow the steps described [here](INSTALL%20AND%20SETUP.md#set-up-a-react-project) to create a new React project with TypeScript.

Once you have set up the project, you can test it by running the development server and opening the application in your web browser.

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

Now that we have set up the project, we need to setup Tailwind CSS for styling the application. We will cover this in the next section.

# Integrating Tailwind CSS for styling

In this section, we will integrate Tailwind CSS into our React project to style the application. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows us to quickly build custom designs without writing any CSS.

:arrow_right: Follow the steps described [here](INSTALL%20AND%20SETUP.md#integrate-tailwind-css) to integrate Tailwind CSS into your React project.
